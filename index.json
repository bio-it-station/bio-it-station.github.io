Inspired by these experiences, I applied bioinformatics to investigate the molecular biology of microRNA while studying for my master’s degree in Plant Biology, National Taiwan University. Apart from research projects, the extensive educational resources provided by NTU empowered me with the latest skills and techniques in bioinformatics. The liberal academic atmosphere and thought provoking courses fostered my ability to conduct independent thinking, an important asset when it comes to interdisciplinary research. Despite spending most of my time on research, I maintained cordial relationships with my advisor and lab-mates, as evidenced by my advisor’s recommendation to the Phi Tau Phi Scholastic Honor Society of the Republic of China and my designation as valedictorian of our institute.\nI was honored to be accepted by Prof. Chien-Yu Chen’s lab, which bestowed upon my expertise in machine learning. This experience aided me in predicting microRNAs target genes with sequencing data using long short-term memory (LSTM). Since biologists might argue that the machine learning model does not explain the necessary features, our tool combines the biological message with a scoring schema to provide biological evidence.\nUnder Professor Chen’s recommendation, I joined the Institute of Information Science in Academia Sinica at Prof. Huai-Kuang Tsai’s laboratory. I started by maintaining all the servers and participating in long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) database research, TRIPBASE, and try to analyze extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) for cancer prediction, calculating the cancer risk score for the healthy person. With both bioinformatics and wet bench experience, I was able to elucidate different molecular mechanisms using predictive biology. My professional goals are to develop algorithms to approach phylogenomics problems and enhance machine learning abilities.

Hsp90, an essential molecular chaperone and a central network hub in eukaryotes, has been observed to suppress or enhance the effects of genetic variation on phenotypic diversity in response to environmental cues. Because many Hsp90-interacting genes are involved in signaling transduction pathways and transcriptional regulation, we tested how common Hsp90-dependent differential gene expression is in natural populations. Many genes exhibited Hsp90-dependent strain-specific differential expression in five diverse yeast strains. We further identified transcription factors (TFs) potentially contributing to variable expression. We found that on Hsp90 inhibition or environmental stress, activities or abundances of Hsp90-dependent TFs varied among strains, resulting in differential strain-specific expression of their target genes, which consequently led to phenotypic diversity. We provide evidence that individual strains can readily display specific Hsp90-dependent gene expression, suggesting that the evolutionary impacts of Hsp90 are widespread in nature.","tags":["Hsp90-dependent gene expression","yeast strains"],"title":"Differential Hsp90-dependent gene expression is strain-specific and common among yeast strains","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kai-Li Chang","Jia-Hong Chen","Tzuchieh Lin","Jun-Yi Leu","Cheng-Fu Kao","Wong Jin Yung","Huai-Kuang Tsai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1682035200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682035200,"objectID":"d4ec1b0edccf978f0a359b1019a0f2ec","permalink":"/publication/kaili-2023/","publishdate":"2023-04-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kaili-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Ubiquitous presence of short extrachromosomal circular DNAs (eccDNAs) in eukaryotic cells has perplexed generations of biologists. Their widespread origins in the genome lacking apparent specificity led some studies to conclude their formation as random or near-random. Despite this, the search for specific formation of short eccDNA continues with a recent surge of interest in biomarker development. Results: To shed new light on the conf licting views on short eccDNAs’ randomness, here we present DeepCircle, a bioinformatics framework incorporating convolution- and attention-based neural networks to assess their predictability. Short human eccDNAs from different datasets indeed have low similarity in genomic locations, but DeepCircle successfully learned shared DNA sequence features to make accurate cross-datasets predictions (accuracy: convolution-based models: 79.65±4.7%, attention-based models: 83.31 ± 4.18%). Conclusions: The excellent performance of our models shows that the intrinsic predictability of eccDNAs is encoded in the sequences across tissue origins.

Ex vivo functional studies revealed that NK subpopulations with high DNAM1 expression had cytolytic activities in response to target cell stimulation.

To develop an automated deep learning classifier for termite image recognition suitable for mobile applications, we used smartphones to acquire 18,000 original images each of four termite pest species: Kalotermitidae: Cryptotermes domesticus (Haviland); Rhinotermitidae: Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki and Reticulitermes flaviceps (Oshima); and Termitidae: Odontotermes formosanus (Shiraki). Each original image included multiple individuals, and we applied five image segmentation techniques for capturing individual termites. We used 24,000 individual-termite images (4 species × 2 castes × 3 groups × 1,000 images) for model development and testing. We implemented a termite classification system by using a deep learning–based model, MobileNetV2. Our models achieved high accuracy scores of 0.947, 0.946, and 0.929 for identifying soldiers, workers, and both castes, respectively, which is not significantly different from human expert performance. We further applied image augmentation techniques, including geometrical transformations and intensity transformations, to individual-termite images. The results revealed that the same classification accuracy can be achieved by using 1,000 augmented images derived from only 200 individual-termite images, thus facilitating further model development on the basis of many fewer original images.

The functional effects of the novel candidates were then validated experimentally, providing solid evidence for their roles in the respective traits. Hence, we conclude that iTARGEX can reliably identify novel factors involved in given biological traits. As such, it is capable of converting genome-wide observations into causal gene function predictions. Further application of iTARGEX in other contexts is expected to facilitate the discovery of new regulators and provide observations for novel mechanistic hypotheses regarding different biological traits and phenotypes.","tags":["iTARGEX","Yeast Deletome","S Phase","Protein Turnover"],"title":"iTARGEX analysis of yeast deletome reveals novel regulators of transcriptional buffering in S phase and protein turnover.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Meng-Jen Wu","Chih-Jung Chen","Ting-Yu Lin","Ying-Yuan Liu","Lin-Lu Tseng","Mei-Ling Cheng","Chih-Pin Chuu","Huai-Kuang Tsai","Wen-Ling Kuo","Hsing-Jien Kung","Wen-Ching Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1611619200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611619200,"objectID":"1537c7af09cdbf13f1d8847717a0c57c","permalink":"/publication/wu-2021/","publishdate":"2021-01-26T11:04:56.375397Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wu-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Rationale: The progression of prostate cancer (PCa) to castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) despite continuous androgen deprivation therapy is a major clinical challenge. Over 90% of patients with CRPC exhibit sustained androgen receptor (AR) signaling. KDM4B that removes the repressive mark H3K9me3/2 is a transcriptional activator of AR and has been implicated in the development of CRPC. However, the mechanisms of KDM4B involvement in CRPC remain largely unknown. Here, we sought to demonstrate the molecular pathway mediated by KDM4B in CRPC and to provide proof-of-concept evidence that KDM4B is a potential CRPC target.\nMethods: CRPC cells (C4-2B or CWR22Rv1) depleted with KDM4B followed by cell proliferation (in vitro and xenograft), microarray, qRT-PCR, Seahorse Flux, and metabolomic analyses were employed to identify the expression and metabolic profiles mediated by KDM4B. Immunoprecipitation was used to determine the KDM4B-c-Myc interaction region. Reporter activity assay and ChIP analysis were used to characterize the KDM4B-c-Myc complex-mediated mechanistic actions. The clinical relevance between KDM4B and c-Myc was determined using UCSC Xena analysis and immunohistochemistry.\nResults: We showed that KDM4B knockdown impaired CRPC proliferation, switched Warburg to OXPHOS metabolism, and suppressed gene expressions including those targeted by c-Myc. We further demonstrated that KDM4B physically interacted with c-Myc and they were co-recruited to the c-Myc-binding sequence on the promoters of metabolic genes (LDHA, ENO1, and PFK). Importantly, KDM4B and c-Myc synergistically promoted the transactivation of the LDHA promoter in a demethylase-dependent manner. We also provided evidence that KDM4B and c-Myc are co-expressed in PCa tissue and that high expression of both is associated with worse clinical outcome.\nConclusions: KDM4B partners with c-Myc and serves as a coactivator of c-Myc to directly enhance c-Myc-mediated metabolism, hence promoting CRPC progression. Targeting KDM4B is thus an alternative therapeutic strategy for advanced prostate cancers driven by c-Myc and AR.","tags":["Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer","KDM4B","c-Myc","Histone Demethylase","Metabolic Rewiring"],"title":"Targeting KDM4B that coactivates c-Myc-regulated metabolism to suppress tumor growth in castration-resistant prostate cancer.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jia-Hsin Huang","Cheng-Hung Tsai","Tzuchieh Lin","Cheng-Kai Shiau","Huai-Kuang Tsai"],"categories":[],"content":"Alternative splicing (AS), the selective removal of exons and reconnection of exons by multiple processes, shapes how genetic information controls important cellular functions in different tissues of higher metazoans.

Transcription-deposited H3K4 methylation (H3K4me) is associated with regions that are susceptible to TRCs; however, the interplay between H3K4me and TRCs is unknown. Here we show that H3K4me aggravates TRC-induced replication failure in checkpoint-defective cells, and the presence of methylated H3K4 slows down ongoing replication. Both S-phase checkpoint activity and H3K4me are crucial for faithful DNA synthesis under replication stress, especially in highly transcribed regions where the presence of H3K4me is highest and TRCs most often occur. H3K4me mitigates TRCs by decelerating ongoing replication, analogous to how speed bumps slow down cars. These findings establish the concept that H3K4me defines the transcriptional status of a genomic region and defends the genome from TRC-mediated replication stress and instability.","tags":["Cell Cycle Proteins","Checkpoint Kinase 2","Chromatin","DNA Polymerase II","DNA Replication","Genome","Fungal","Genomic Instability","Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase","Histones","Methylation","Models","Genetic","Mutation","S Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints","Saccharomyces cerevisiae","Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins","Transcription","Genetic","genetics","metabolism"],"title":"H3K4 methylation at active genes mitigates transcription-replication conflicts during replication stress.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sufeng Chiang","Hisaaki Shinohara","Jia-Hsin Huang","Huai-Kuang Tsai","Mariko Okada"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580515200,"objectID":"94d6c970bbae441d64c7b07a1f8fb035","permalink":"/publication/chiang-2020/","publishdate":"2020-05-04T11:04:56.368504Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chiang-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Eukaryotic transcription factors (TFs) coordinate different upstream signals to regulate the expression of their target genes.

The DNA-binding specificities of TFs may be diversified or produce new variants in different eukaryotic species. However, it is currently unclear how various levels of divergence in TF DNA-binding specificities or motifs became introduced into the cis-regulatory DNA regions of the genome over evolutionary time. Here, we first estimated the evolutionary divergence levels of TF binding motifs and quantified their occurrence at DNase I-hypersensitive sites. Results from our in silico motif scan and experimentally derived chromatin immunoprecipitation (TF-ChIP) show that the divergent motifs tend to be introduced in the edges of cis-regulatory regions, which is probably accompanied by the expansion of the accessible core of promoter-associated regulatory elements during evolution. We also find that the genes neighboring the expanded cis-regulatory regions with the most divergent motifs are associated with functions like development and morphogenesis. Accordingly, we propose that the accumulation of divergent motifs in the edges of cis-regulatory regions provides a functional mechanism for the evolution of divergent regulatory circuits.","tags":null,"title":"Borders of Cis-Regulatory DNA Sequences Preferentially Harbor the Divergent Transcription Factor Binding Motifs in the Human Genome","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Nice weather and amazing labmates, we walked from Academia Sinica to Xiangshan!\n","date":1495437121,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1495437121,"objectID":"50c3ed78d5c3495b38eb3dd7edbb4fa3","permalink":"/post/2017-05-22-lab-hiking/","publishdate":"2017-05-22T15:12:01+08:00","relpermalink":"/post/2017-05-22-lab-hiking/","section":"post","summary":"Nice weather and amazing labmates, we walked from Academia Sinica to Xiangshan!","tags":[],"title":"Lab Hiking","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"We cycled 40km from Academia to Tamsui.

Recently, three possible scenarios of lincRNA origins have been proposed: de novo origination from intergenic regions, duplication from other long noncoding RNAs, and pseudogenization from protein-coding genes. The first two scenarios are largely studied and supported, yet few studies focused on the evolution from pseudogenized protein-coding sequence to lincRNA. Due to the non-mutually exclusive nature of these three scenarios and the need of systematic investigation of lincRNA origination, we conducted a comparative genomics study to investigate the evolution of human lincRNAs. Results: Combining with syntenic analysis and stringent Blastn e-value cutoff, we found that the majority of lincRNAs are aligned to intergenic regions of other species. Interestingly, 193 human lincRNAs could have protein-coding orthologs in at least two of nine vertebrates. Transposable elements in these conserved regions in human genome are much less than expectation. Moreover, 19% of these lincRNAs have overlaps with or are close to pseudogenes in the human genome. Conclusions: We suggest that a notable portion of lincRNAs could be derived from pseudogenized protein-coding genes. Furthermore, based on our computational analysis, we hypothesize that a subset of these lincRNAs could have potential to regulate their paralogs by functioning as competing endogenous RNAs. Our results provide evolutionary evidence of the relationship between human lincRNAs and protein-coding genes.","tags":["","Animals","Competing endogenous RNA","Culicidae","Databases","Drosophila","Genes","Insect","Long intergenic noncoding RNAs","Messenger","Nucleic Acid","Pseudogenization","RNA","Species Specificity","Syntenic analysis","Transposable element","User-Computer Interface","genetics"],"title":"Comparative genomic analyses highlight the contribution of pseudogenized protein-coding genes to human lincRNAs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["I-Man Ng","Jia-Hsin Huang","Shang-Chi Tsai","Huai-Kuang Tsai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"6ab909bbcc0f754a26e3ad3f0ca0aa4f","permalink":"/publication/ng-2017/","publishdate":"2020-05-04T11:14:39.096878Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ng-2017/","section":"publication","summary":" Alternative splicing (AS), a mechanism by which different forms of mature messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are generated from the same gene, widely occurs in the metazoan genomes.

The results showed that the expression of crdS was significantly increased upon exposure to nitric oxide (NO). crdS-knockout (DeltacrdS) and crdR/crdS-knockout (DeltacrdRS) H. pylori, but not arsS-knockout (DeltaarsS) or fleS-knockout (DeltafleS) H. pylori, showed a significant loss of viability upon exposure to NO compared with wild-type strain. Knockin crdS (DeltacrdS-in) significantly restored viability in the presence of NO. Global transcriptional profiling analysis of wild-type and DeltacrdS H. pylori in the presence or absence of NO showed that 101 genes were differentially expressed, including copper resistance determinant A (crdA), transport, binding and envelope proteins. The CrdR binding motifs were investigated by competitive electrophoretic mobility shift assay, which revealed that the two AC-rich regions in the crdA promoter region are required for binding. These results demonstrate that CrdR-crdA interaction enables H. pylori to survive under nitrosative stress.","tags":["Bacterial Proteins","Base Sequence","Copper","DNA-Binding Proteins","Gene Expression Profiling","Gene Knockout Techniques","Helicobacter pylori","Molecular Sequence Data","Nitric Oxide","Promoter Regions","Genetic","Stress","Physiological","genetics","metabolism"],"title":"The CrdRS two-component system in Helicobacter pylori responds to nitrosative stress.","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Lab Camping\n","date":1422515296,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1422515296,"objectID":"68cbad4873175e5673137593742d425a","permalink":"/post/2015-01-29-lab-camping/","publishdate":"2015-01-29T15:08:16+08:00","relpermalink":"/post/2015-01-29-lab-camping/","section":"post","summary":"Lab Camping","tags":[],"title":"Lab Camping","type":"post"},{"authors":["Zing Tsung-Yeh Tsai","Shin-Han Shiu","Huai-Kuang Tsai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"e86cfcbc2e146c4de1dc9a37fd6edf45","permalink":"/publication/10-1371-journal-pcbi-1004418/","publishdate":"2020-05-04T11:04:56.370013Z","relpermalink":"/publication/10-1371-journal-pcbi-1004418/","section":"publication","summary":"Author Summary Identification of transcription factor binding sites based on sequence motifs is typically accompanied by a high false positive rate. Increasing evidence suggests that there are many other factors besides DNA sequence that may affect the binding and interaction of TFs with DNA. Through the integration of sequence motif, chromatin state, and DNA structure properties, we show that TF binding can be better predicted. Moreover, considering chromatin state and DNA structure properties simultaneously yields a significant improvement. While the binding of some TFs can be readily predicted using either chromatin state information or DNA structure, other TFs need both. Thus, our findings provide insights on how different histone modifications and DNA structure properties may influence the binding of a particular TF and thus how TFs regulate gene expression. These features are referred to as sequence “intrinsic properties” because they can be predicted from sequences alone. These intrinsic properties can be used to build a TF binding prediction model that has a similar performance to considering all features. Moreover, the intrinsic property model allows TFBS predictions not only across TFs, but also across DNA-binding domain families that are present in most eukaryotes, suggesting that the model likely can be used across species.","tags":null,"title":"Contribution of Sequence Motif, Chromatin State, and DNA Structure Features to Predictive Models of Transcription Factor Binding in Yeast","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jen-Hao Cheng","David Zhi-Chao Pan","Zing Tsung-Yeh Tsai","Huai-Kuang Tsai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"2ed517fe82d498a224085f10c576cf5a","permalink":"/publication/cheng-2015/","publishdate":"2020-05-04T11:04:56.369849Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cheng-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"Enhancers play a crucial role in gene regulation but the participation of enhancer transcripts (i.e. enhancer RNA, eRNAs) in regulatory systems remains unclear. We provide a computational analysis on eRNAs using genome-wide data across 12 mouse tissues. The expression of genes targeted by transcribing enhancer is positively correlated with eRNA expression and significantly higher than expression of genes targeted by non-transcribing enhancers. This result implies eRNA transcription indicates a state of enhancer that further increases gene expression. This state of enhancer is tissue-specific, as the same enhancer differentially transcribes eRNAs across tissues. Therefore, the presence of eRNAs describes a tissue-specific state of enhancer that is generally associated with higher expressed target genes, surmising as to whether eRNAs have gene activation potential. We further found a large number of eRNAs contain regions in which sequences and secondary structures are similar to microRNAs. Interestingly, an increasing number of recent studies hypothesize that microRNAs may switch from their general repressive role to an activating role when targeting promoter sequences. Collectively, our results provide speculation that eRNAs may be associated with the selective activation of enhancer target genes.","tags":null,"title":"Genome-wide analysis of enhancer RNA in gene regulation across 12 mouse tissues","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"David and Wan-Hsin delivered oral presentation on their projects, and Ryan presented a poster on his project in ISEGB 2014.\nDavid won The Best Student Oral Presentation Award, and Ryan won second place for The Best Poster Award!

In particular, G-quadruplex (G4) may affect alternative splicing based on its ability to impede the activity of RNA polymerase II. However, the specific role of non-B DNA structures in splicing regulation still awaits investigation. Here, we provide a genome-wide and cross-species investigation of the associations between five non-B DNA structures and exon skipping. Our results indicate a statistically significant correlation of each examined non-B DNA structures with exon skipping in both human and mouse. We further show that the contributions of non-B DNA structures to exon skipping are influenced by the occurring region. These correlations and contributions are also significantly different in human and mouse. Finally, we detailed the effects of G4 by showing that occurring on the template strand and the length of G-run, which is highly related to the stability of a G4 structure, are significantly correlated with exon skipping activity. We thus show that, in addition to the well-known effects of RNA and protein structure, the relative positional arrangement of intronic non-B DNA structures may also impact exon skipping.","tags":null,"title":"Associations between intronic non-B DNA structures and exon skipping","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Chih-Hsu Gets Married!

Understanding the impacts of these two factors on the rate of protein sequence evolution is of great importance in evolutionary biology. While many biological factors associated with evolutionary rate variations have been studied, evolutionary analysis of simultaneously accounting for TF and miRNA regulations across metazoans is still uninvestigated. Here, we provide a series of statistical analyses to assess the influences of TF and miRNA regulations on evolutionary rates across metazoans (human, mouse and fruit fly). Our results reveal that the negative correlations between trans-regulation and evolutionary rates hold well across metazoans, but the strength of TF regulation as a rate indicator becomes weak when the other confounding factors that may affect evolutionary rates are controlled. We show that miRNA regulation tends to be a more essential indicator of evolutionary rates than TF regulation, and the combination of TF and miRNA regulations has a significant dependent effect on protein evolutionary rates. We also show that trans-regulation (especially miRNA regulation) is much more important in human/mouse than in fruit fly in determining protein evolutionary rates, suggesting a considerable variation in rate determinants between vertebrates and invertebrates.","tags":["Animals","Binding Sites","Drosophila melanogaster","Evolution","Molecular","Gene Expression Regulation","Humans","Mice","MicroRNAs","Proteins","Transcription Factors","genetics","metabolism"],"title":"The impact of trans-regulation on the evolutionary rates of metazoan proteins.","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Year-End Party at Jiufeng and Jingguashi\n","date":1358851465,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1358851465,"objectID":"0c634f24766a5f83147a8d9d4380441d","permalink":"/post/2013-01-22-jiufeng-and-jingguashi/","publishdate":"2013-01-22T18:44:25+08:00","relpermalink":"/post/2013-01-22-jiufeng-and-jingguashi/","section":"post","summary":"Year-End Party at Jiufeng and Jingguashi","tags":[],"title":"Jiufeng and Jingguashi","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Zing and Francis presented their work at the Exchange Workshop between Center for Genome Research (CRG), Spain and Academia Sinica (AS), Taiwan.\n","date":1354099377,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1354099377,"objectID":"245832591e8d75263935843734719ebb","permalink":"/post/2012-11-28-crg-and-as-exchange-workshop/","publishdate":"2012-11-28T18:42:57+08:00","relpermalink":"/post/2012-11-28-crg-and-as-exchange-workshop/","section":"post","summary":"Zing and Francis presented their work at the Exchange Workshop between Center for Genome Research (CRG), Spain and Academia Sinica (AS), Taiwan.","tags":[],"title":"CRG and as Exchange Workshop","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Zing was awarded Best Oral Presentation for his research on \u0026ldquo;Evolution of Cis-Regulatory Features in Yeast De Novo Genes\u0026rdquo;

Discriminating between the compositional differences of metagenomes is an important and challenging problem. Several distance functions have been proposed to estimate the differences based on functional profiles or taxonomic distributions; however, the strengths and limitations of such functions are still unclear. Initially, we analyzed three well-known distance functions and found very little difference between them in the clustering of samples. This motivated us to incorporate suitable normalizations and phylogenetic information into the functions so that we could cluster samples from both real and synthetic data sets. The results indicate significant improvement in sample clustering over that derived by rank-based normalization with phylogenetic information, regardless of whether the samples are from real or synthetic microbiomes. Furthermore, our findings suggest that considering suitable normalizations and phylogenetic information is essential when designing distance functions for estimating the differences between metagenomes. We conclude that incorporating rank-based normalization with phylogenetic information into the distance functions helps achieve reliable clustering results.","tags":["Phylogeny","Accuracy","Communities","Bioinformatics","Correlation","Reliability","Computational Biology","Clustering","Metagenomics","Normalization","Phylogenetic Information","Distance Functions"],"title":"The Impact of Normalization and Phylogenetic Information on Estimating the Distance for Metagenomes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sufeng Chiang","Krishna B S Swamy","Ting-Wei Hsu","Zing Tsung-Yeh Tsai","Henry Horng-Shing Lu","Daryi Wang","Huai-Kuang Tsai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"9c5cd6bfa1bd5a3e832b0255ea153735","permalink":"/publication/chiang-2012/","publishdate":"2020-05-04T11:04:56.371297Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chiang-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"It is generally accepted that genes are regulated by the interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their binding sites (TFBSs).

Given that, even low-affinity TF-DNA interactions are abundant in vivo; we used both low- and high-affinity TFBSs and performed a genome-wide analysis of associations between variable positions and co-TFs. We found that, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, approximately 14% of the variable positions in TFBSs demonstrate such associations. These associations occurred in close proximity on the same promoters (i.e., highly co-localized).

Previous studies have used target genes shared by two TFs as a clue to infer TF-TF interactions. However, this task remains challenging because the target genes with low binding affinity are frequently omitted by experimental data, especially when a single strict threshold is employed. This article aims at improving the accuracy of inferring TF-TF interactions by incorporating motif discovery as a fundamental step when detecting overlapping targets of TFs based on ChIP-chip data. The proposed method, simTFBS, outperforms three naïve methods that adopt fixed thresholds when inferring TF-TF interactions based on ChIP-chip data. In addition, simTFBS is compared with two advanced methods and demonstrates its advantages in predicting TF-TF interactions. By comparing simTFBS with predictions based on the set of available annotated yeast TF binding motifs, we demonstrate that the good performance of simTFBS is indeed coming from the additional motifs found by the proposed procedures.

Though the profound impact of nucleosome positions on gene regulation has been reported, their influence on transcriptional evolution is still less explored.

The improvement in sequencing technology, which yields a large amount of sequence data, has led to major breakthroughs in the field. However, at present, taxonomic binning tools for metagenomes discard 30-40% of Sanger sequencing data due to the stringency of BLAST cut-offs. In an attempt to provide a comprehensive overview of metagenomic data, we re-analyzed the discarded metagenomes by using less stringent cut-offs. Additionally, we introduced a new criterion, namely, the evolutionary conservation of adjacency between neighboring genes. To evaluate the feasibility of our approach, we re-analyzed discarded contigs and singletons from several environments with different levels of complexity. We also compared the consistency between our taxonomic binning and those reported in the original studies. RESULTS: Among the discarded data, we found that 23.7 +/- 3.9% of singletons and 14.1 +/- 1.0% of contigs were assigned to taxa. The recovery rates for singletons were higher than those for contigs. The Pearson correlation coefficient revealed a high degree of similarity (0.94 +/- 0.03 at the phylum rank and 0.80 +/- 0.11 at the family rank) between the proposed taxonomic binning approach and those reported in original studies. In addition, an evaluation using simulated data demonstrated the reliability of the proposed approach.

In other words, utilizing the conserved gene order as a criterion will reduce the amount of data discarded when analyzing metagenomes.","tags":["Algorithms","Base Sequence","Databases","Factual","Gene Order","Metagenomics","Sequence Analysis","DNA","methods"],"title":"Reanalyze unassigned reads in Sanger based metagenomic data using conserved gene  adjacency.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Krishna B S Swamy","Chung-Yi Cho","Sufeng Chiang","Zing Tsung-Yeh Tsai","Huai-Kuang Tsai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1251763200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1251763200,"objectID":"1ac95ae7e2254b1ee91951ad4b0b16a1","permalink":"/publication/swamy-2009/","publishdate":"2020-05-04T11:04:56.372701Z","relpermalink":"/publication/swamy-2009/","section":"publication","summary":"Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression by binding to specific binding sites (TFBSs) in gene promoters.

In this article, we propose a method for studying the relationship between the expression of target genes and nucleotide variants in TFBS motifs at a genome-wide scale in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, especially the combinatorial effects of variants at two positions.

We define such positions as ‘functional'. However, some positions are only functional as dependent pairs, but not individually. In addition, a significant proportion of the functional positions have been well conserved across all yeast-related species studied. We also find that some positions require the presence of co-occurring TFs, while others maintain their functionality in the absence of a co-occurring TF.

We used Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism to estimate the relative contributions of cis and trans variations to the expression divergence between a laboratory (BY) and a wild (RM) strain of yeast. We examined whether genes regulated by a single transcription factor (TF; single input module, SIM genes) or genes regulated by multiple TFs (multiple input module, MIM genes) are more susceptible to trans variation. Because a SIM gene is regulated by a single immediate upstream TF, the chance for a change to occur in its trans-acting factors would, on average, be smaller than that for a MIM gene. We chose 232 genes that exhibited expression divergence between BY and RM to test this hypothesis. We examined the expression patterns of these genes in a BY–RM coculture system and in a BY–RM diploid hybrid. We found that trans variation is far more important than cis variation for expression divergence between the two strains. However, because in 75% of the genes studied, cis variation has significantly contributed to expression divergence, cis change also plays a significant role in intraspecific expression evolution. Interestingly, we found that the proportion of genes with diverged expression between BY and RM is larger for MIM genes than for SIM genes; in fact, the proportion tends to increase with the number of transcription factors that regulate the gene. Moreover, MIM genes are, on average, subject to stronger trans effects than SIM genes, though the difference between the two types of genes is not conspicuous.","tags":null,"title":"Roles of Trans and Cis Variation in Yeast Intraspecies Evolution of Gene Expression","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yao-Lin Chang","Huai-Kuang Tsai","Cheng-Yan Kao","Yung-Chian Chen","Yuh-Jyh Hu","Jinn-Moon Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1209600000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1209600000,"objectID":"0df9f238eaa32b5a7bfe1d931c0f1b7f","permalink":"/publication/chang-2008/","publishdate":"2020-05-04T11:04:56.373087Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chang-2008/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: DNA-binding proteins are of utmost importance to gene regulation.

We use ChIP-chip data to judge the binding strength of a TF to a putative target promoter and use orthologous sequences from related species to judge the degree of evolutionary conservation of a predicted TFBS. Candidate motifs are constructed by growing compact motif blocks and by concatenating two candidate blocks, allowing 0-15 degenerate positions in between. The resultant patterns are statistically evaluated for their ability to distinguish between target and nontarget genes. Then, a position-based ranking procedure is proposed to enhance the signals of true motifs by collecting position concurrences. Empirical tests on 32 known yeast TFBSs show that the method is highly accurate in identifying gapped motifs, outperforming current methods, and it also works well on ungapped motifs.

Sharing of regulatory elements within the intergenic region of those adjacent gene pairs was often considered the major mechanism responsible for such co-expression. However, it is still in debate to what extent that common transcription factors (TFs) contribute to the co-expression of adjacent genes. In order to resolve the evolutionary aspect of this issue, we investigated the conservation of adjacent pairs in five yeast species. By using the information for TF binding sites in promoter regions available from the MYBS database http://bits.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~mybs/ , the ratios of TF-sharing pairs among all the adjacent pairs in yeast genomes were analyzed. The levels of co-expression in different adjacent patterns were also compared.\n\nRESULTS:\n\nOur analyses showed that the proportion of adjacent pairs conserved in five yeast species is relatively low compared to that in the mammalian lineage. The proportion was also low for adjacent gene pairs with shared TFs. Particularly, the statistical analysis suggested that co-expression of adjacent gene pairs was not noticeably associated with the sharing of TFs in these pairs. We further proposed a case of the PAC (polymerase A and C) and RRPE (rRNA processing element) motifs which co-regulate divergent/bidirectional pairs, and found that the shared TFs were not significantly relevant to co-expression of divergent promoters among adjacent genes. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that the commonly shared cis-regulatory system does not solely contribute to the co-expression of adjacent gene pairs in yeast genome.

The strengths and limitations of numerous well-known genetic operators are first analyzed, along with local search methods for TSPs from their solution qualities and mechanisms for preserving and adding edges. Based on this analysis, a new approach, HeSEA is proposed which integrates edge assembly crossover (EAX) and Lin-Kernighan (LK) local search, through family competition and heterogeneous pairing selection. This study demonstrates experimentally that EAX and LK can compensate for each other's disadvantages. Family competition and heterogeneous pairing selections are used to maintain the diversity of the population, which is especially useful for evolutionary algorithms in solving large TSPs. The proposed method was evaluated on 16 well-known TSPs in which the numbers of cities range from 318 to 13 509. Experimental results indicate that HeSEA performs well and is very competitive with other approaches. The proposed method can determine the optimum path when the number of cities is under 10 000 and the mean solution quality is within 0.0074% above the optimum for each test problem. These findings imply that the proposed method can find tours robustly with a fixed small population and a limited family competition length in reasonable time, when used to solve large TSPs.","tags":["Genetic;Models","Theoretical","evolutionary computation;travelling salesman problems;heterogeneous selection evolutionary algorithm;HeSEA;large traveling salesman problem;TSP;genetic operator;edge assembly crossover;EAX;Lin-Kernighan local search;family competition;LK heuristic;Evolutionary computation;Traveling salesman problems;Cities and towns;Bioinformatics;Genetics;Search methods;Assembly;Computer science;Optimization methods;Testing;Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Decision Support Techniques;Evolution;Models"],"title":"An evolutionary algorithm for large traveling salesman problems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huai-Kuang Tsai","Jinn-Moon Yang","Yuan-Fang Tsai","Cheng-Yan Kao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1086048000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1086048000,"objectID":"038d43ce20524a9094fa8766b70004bb","permalink":"/publication/tsai-2004/","publishdate":"2020-05-04T11:04:56.374526Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tsai-2004/","section":"publication","summary":"This study presents an evolutionary algorithm, called a heterogeneous selection genetic algorithm (HeSGA), for analyzing the patterns of gene expression on microarray data. Microarray technologies have provided the means to monitor the expression levels of a large number of genes simultaneously. Gene clustering and gene ordering are important in analyzing a large body of microarray expression data. The proposed method simultaneously solves gene clustering and gene-ordering problems by integrating global and local search mechanisms. Clustering and ordering information is used to identify functionally related genes and to infer genetic networks from immense microarray expression data. HeSGA was tested on eight test microarray datasets, ranging in size from 147 to 6221 genes. The experimental clustering and visual results indicate that HeSGA not only ordered genes smoothly but also grouped genes with similar gene expressions. Visualized results and a new scoring function that references predefined functional categories were employed to confirm the biological interpretations of results yielded using HeSGA and other methods. These results indicate that HeSGA has potential in analyzing gene expression patterns.","tags":["Algorithms","Cluster Analysis","Computer Simulation","DNA Mutational Analysis","Evolution","Molecular","Gene Expression Profiling","Gene Expression Regulation","Genetic Linkage","Genetic Variation","Models","Genetic","Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Sequence Analysis","DNA","genetics","methods"],"title":"An evolutionary approach for gene expression patterns.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yu Cheng Huang","Han Yu Chuang","Huai-Kuang Tsai","Chun Fan Chang","Cheng Yan Kao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1072915200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1072915200,"objectID":"cec95c1d52dd46a26074ffc9de3beb77","permalink":"/publication/inproceedings/","publishdate":"2020-05-05T08:59:00.345725Z","relpermalink":"/publication/inproceedings/","section":"publication","summary":"Reducing the number of needed primers in multiplex polymerase chain reaction experiments is useful, or even essential, in large scale genomic research. In this paper, we transform this multiple-use primer design problem into a set-covering problem, and propose a modified compact genetic algorithm (MCGA) approach to disclose optimal solutions. Our experimental results demonstrate that MCGA effectively reduces the primer numbers of multiplex PCR experiments among whole-genome data sets of four test species within a feasible computation time, especially when applied on complex genomes. Moreover, the performance of MCGA further exhibits better global stability of optimal solutions than conventional heuristic methods that may fall into local optimal traps. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","tags":null,"title":"Designing multiple-use primer set for multiplex PCR by using compact GAs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.-K.

We analyzed the strengths and limitations of several well-known genetic operators for TSPs by the experiments. To evaluate these factors, we propose a new genetic algorithm integrating two genetic operators and a heterogeneous pairing selection. The former can preserve and add good edges efficiently and the later will be able to keep the population diversity. The proposed approach was evaluated on 15 well-known TSPs whose numbers of cities range from 101 to 13509. Experimental results indicated that our approach, somewhat slower, performs very robustly and is very competitive with other approaches in our best surveys. We believe that a genetic algorithm can be a stable approach for TSPs if its operators can preserve and add edges efficiently and it maintains population diversity.","tags":null,"title":"Some issues of designing genetic algorithms for traveling salesman problems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huai-Kuang Tsai","Jinn Moon Yang","Yuan Fang Tsai","Cheng Yan Kao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1041379200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1041379200,"objectID":"21d853a68868592a9a2d583ae5eed4bc","permalink":"/publication/article/","publishdate":"2020-05-05T10:04:35.793777Z","relpermalink":"/publication/article/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper proposes a genetic algorithm, called the heterogeneous selection genetic algorithm (HSGA), integrating local and global strategies via family competition and edge similarity, for the traveling salesman problem (TSP).

Based on the mechanisms of preserving and adding edges, the search behaviors of neighbor-join mutation and edge assembly crossover are studied.

This approach, referred to as the Gaussian Evolutionary Method (GEM), combines both discrete and continuous global search mechanisms. The former helps speed up convergence by reducing the size of rotamer space, whereas the latter, integrating decreasing-based Gaussian mutations and self-adaptive Gaussian mutations, continuously adapts dihedrals to optimal conformations. We tested our approach on 38 proteins ranging in size from 46 to 325 residues and showed that the results were comparable to those using other methods. The average accuracies of our predictions were 80% for chi(1), 66% for chi(1 + 2), and 1.36 A for the root mean square deviation of side-chain positions. We found that if our scoring function was perfect, the prediction accuracy was also essentially perfect. However, perfect prediction could not be achieved if only a discrete search mechanism was applied. These results suggest that GEM is robust and can be used to examine the factors limiting the accuracy of protein side-chain prediction methods. Furthermore, it can be used to systematically evaluate and thus improve scoring functions.","tags":["Algorithms","Amino Acids","Computational Biology","Databases","Protein","Models","Chemical","Mutagenesis","Peptide Library","Protein Conformation","Proteins","Recombination","Genetic","Static Electricity","Statistics as Topic","Thermodynamics","chemistry","classification","genetics","methods"],"title":"GEM: a Gaussian Evolutionary Method for predicting protein side-chain conformations.","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f969157211e79e181e3ae4b1815bbb47","permalink":"/admin_profile/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin_profile/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c61bd17da54e6598c71ab43046ec8671","permalink":"/alumni/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/alumni/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
