 abstract = {Eukaryotic transcription factors (TFs) coordinate different upstream signals to regulate the expression of their target genes. To unveil this regulatory network in B-cell receptor signaling, we developed a computational pipeline to systematically analyze the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)- and I$Ä…ppa$B kinase (IKK)-dependent transcriptome responses. We combined a bilinear regression method and kinetic modeling to identify the signal-to-TF and TF-to-gene dynamics, respectively. We input a set of time-course experimental data for B cells and concentrated on transcriptional activators. The results show that the combination of TFs differentially controlled by ERK and IKK could contribute divergent expression dynamics in orchestrating the B-cell response. Our findings provide insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying signal-dependent gene expression in eukaryotic cells.},
