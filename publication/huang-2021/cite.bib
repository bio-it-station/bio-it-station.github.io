    abstract = "{Integrating omics data with quantification of biological traits provides unparalleled opportunities for discovery of genetic regulators by in silico inference. However, current approaches to analyze genetic-perturbation screens are limited by their reliance on annotation libraries for prioritization of hits and subsequent targeted experimentation. Here, we present iTARGEX (identification of Trait-Associated Regulatory Genes via mixture regression using EXpectation maximization), an association framework with no requirement of a priori knowledge of gene function. After creating this tool, we used it to test associations between gene expression profiles and two biological traits in single-gene deletion budding yeast mutants, including transcription homeostasis during S phase and global protein turnover. For each trait, we discovered novel regulators without prior functional annotations. The functional effects of the novel candidates were then validated experimentally, providing solid evidence for their roles in the respective traits. Hence, we conclude that iTARGEX can reliably identify novel factors involved in given biological traits. As such, it is capable of converting genome-wide observations into causal gene function predictions. Further application of iTARGEX in other contexts is expected to facilitate the discovery of new regulators and provide observations for novel mechanistic hypotheses regarding different biological traits and phenotypes.}",
