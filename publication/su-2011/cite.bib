 abstract = {Summary: MetaABC is a metagenomic platform that integrates several binning tools coupled with methods for removing artifacts, analyzing unassigned reads and controlling sampling biases. It allows users to arrive at a better interpretation via series of distinct combinations of analysis tools. After execution, MetaABC provides outputs in various visual formats such as tables, pie and bar charts as well as clustering result diagrams.Availability: MetaABC source code and documentation are available at http://bits2.iis.sinica.edu.tw/MetaABC/Contact:dywang@gate.sinica.edu.tw; hktsai@iis.sinica.edu.twSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
